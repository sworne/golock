## golock
<Samuel Worne samuel@worne.xyz>

A small go application to take a screenshot on linux systems and pixelate the result, origionally intended for use with applications such as xscreensaver or alock.

Just a rewrite of other similar applications, but in golang as I couldn't find anything similar already in the language.
